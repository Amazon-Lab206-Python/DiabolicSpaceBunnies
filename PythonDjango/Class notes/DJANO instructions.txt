1. create virtual environment
> python -m virtualenv djangoEnv
> call djangoEnv/scripts/activate
(djangoEnv)>pip install django

2. create django project
 > django-admin startproject main

2.1 Navigate into the main directory that you just created. 
"python manage.py runserver"

 > cd main
  # Make a new apps directory
  > mkdir apps
  # Navigate into apps
  > cd apps

 create an __init__.py file.
# PCs: (Command Prompt)
  > nul> __init__.py

manage.py file was automatically created-- call it!
> python ../manage.py startapp first_app  #created a new app

in settings.py, add "apps.first_app" to INSTALLED_APPS list.

nav to main folder
python manage.py runserver from the terminal
proceed to localhost: 8000

~*~*~* url*~*~*~*~
1. main/urls.py

  from django.conf.urls import url, include # Notice we added include
  from django.contrib import admin
  urlpatterns = [
      url(r'^', include('apps.first_app.urls')) # And now we use the include function to pull in our first_app.urls...
  ]

2. make urls file.
> cd apps/first_app
>nul> urls.py

 from django.conf.urls import url
  from . import views           # This line is new!
  urlpatterns = [
    url(r'^$', views.index)     # This line has changed!
  ]

3. VIEWS
apps/first_app/views.py

  from django.shortcuts import render, HttpResponse, redirect
  # the index function is called when root is visited
  def index(request):
    response = "Hello, I am your first request!"
    return HttpResponse(response)

Here is a cheat sheet for expressions you'll be using regularly:

'^' Matches the following characters at the beginning of a string. Example: '^a' matches 'anna' but not 'banana'.
'$' Matches the previous characters at the end of a string. Example: 'a$' matches 'anna' and 'banana' but not 'fan'.
'[]' Matches any value in a range. Example: '[0-9]' matches '9' and '9s'.
'{n}' Matches n number or more repetitions of the preceding pattern. Example: '[0-9]{2}' matches '91' and '9834' but not '9'
\d Matches digits.  Example: "\d" matches "8" and "877x"
\d+ matches a string with one or more digits
\w Matches characters.
\w+ matches a string with one or more character/word

Examples of Regular Expression
url(r'^articles/(?P\d+)$', views.show)
url(r'^articles/(?P\w+)$', views.show_word)
url(r'^articles/2003/$', views.special_case_2003)
url(r'^articles/(?P[0-9]{4})$', views.year_archive)
url(r'^articles/(?P[0-9]{4})/(?P[0-9]{2}$', views.month_archive)
